This repository contains old versions of the "set.mm" Metamath database for
first-order set theory.  Each revision corresponds to an archived version of
set.mm.  Files have been split for more efficient storage and easier perusal.
If you need to reconstruct a complete set.mm file, use:

cat $(cat MANIFEST)

or the local equivalent.  Note that you cannot assume old versions of set.mm
can be loaded unmodified in current versions of metamath.

For the current version of set.mm and extensive supplemental information, see:
