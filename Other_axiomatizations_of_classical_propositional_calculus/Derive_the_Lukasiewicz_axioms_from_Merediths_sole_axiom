  $( Carew Meredith's sole axiom for propositional calculus.  This amazing
     formula is thought to be the shortest possible single axiom for
     propositional calculus with inference rule ~ ax-mp , where negation and
     implication are primitive.  Here we prove Meredith's axiom from ~ ax-1 ,
     ~ ax-2 , and ~ ax-3 .  Then from it we derive the Lukasiewicz axioms
     ~ luk-1 , ~ luk-2 , and ~ luk-3 .  Using these we finally re-derive our
     axioms as ~ ax1 , ~ ax2 , and ~ ax3 , thus proving the equivalence of all
     three systems.  C. A. Meredith, "Single Axioms for the Systems (C,N),
     (C,O) and (A,N) of the Two-Valued Propositional Calculus," _The Journal of
     Computing Systems_ vol. 1 (1953), pp. 155-164.  Meredith claimed to be
     close to a proof that this axiom is the shortest possible, but the proof
     was apparently never completed.

     An obscure Irish lecturer, Meredith (1904-1976) became enamored with logic
     somewhat late in life after attending talks by Lukasiewicz and produced
     many remarkable results such as this axiom.  From his obituary:  "He did
     logic whenever time and opportunity presented themselves, and he did it on
     whatever materials came to hand: in a pub, his favored pint of porter
     within reach, he would use the inside of cigarette packs to write proofs
     for logical colleagues."  (The proof was shortened by Andrew Salmon,
     25-Jul-2011.) $)
