  $( Extend class notation to include unary minus.  The symbol ` -u ` is
     not a class by itself but part of a compound class definition.  We
     do this rather than making it a formal function since it is so
     commonly used.  Note: We use a different symbol for unary minus ( ` -u ` )
     and subtraction ( ` - ` ) to prevent syntax ambiguity.  For example,
     if we used the same symbol, then " ` ( - A - B ) ` " could represent
     the (meaningless) operation of class " ` - ` " ~ cmin and unary minus
     class " ` - B ` " connected with operator " ` A ` " in ~ co .  On the
     other hand, " ` ( -u A - B ) ` " is unambiguous.
