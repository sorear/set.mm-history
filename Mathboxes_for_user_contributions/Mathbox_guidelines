  $( (_This theorem is a dummy placeholder for these guidelines.  The name of
     this theorem, "mathbox", is hard-coded into the Metamath program to
     identify the start of the mathbox section for web page generation_.)

     A "mathbox" is a user-contributed section that is maintained by its
     contributor independently from the main part of set.mm.

     _For contributors_:

     By making a contribution, you agree to release it into the public domain,
     according to the statement at the beginning of set.mm.

     Mathboxes are provided to help keep your work synchronized with changes in
     set.mm, but they shouldn't be depended on as a permanent archive.  If you
     want to preserve your original contribution, it is your responsibility to
     keep your own copy of it along with the version of set.mm that works with
     it.

     _Guidelines_:

     1.  If at all possible, please use only 0-ary class constants for new
     definitions.

     2.  Try to follow the style of the rest of set.mm in terms of indentation,
     line length (79 characters or less), and comment markup (see "Auxiliary
     keywords" under HELP LANGUAGE in metamath.exe).  Each $p and $a statement
     must be immediately preceded with the comment that will be shown on its
     web page description.  All mathbox content will be on public display and
     should hopefully reflect the overall quality of the web site.

     3.  Before submitting a revised mathbox, please make sure it verifies
     against the current set.mm.

     4.  Mathboxes should be independent.  To verify this, verify your mathbox
     with all other mathboxes removed.  If you need a theorem from another
     mathbox, let me know so I can move the theorem to the main section.
     Please do not run 'minimize' against theorems in other mathboxes.

     _Notes_:

     1.  I may decide to move some theorems to the main part of set.mm for
     general use.  In that case, an author acknowledgment will be added to the
     description of the theorem.

     2.  I may make changes to mathboxes to maintain the overall quality of
     set.mm.  Normally I will let you know if a change might impact what you
     are working on.

     3.  If you use theorems from another user's mathbox, I don't provide
     assurance that they are based on correct or consistent $a statements.  (If
     you find such a problem, please let me know so it can be corrected.) $)
