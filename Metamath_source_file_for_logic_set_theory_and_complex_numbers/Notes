1. To read this source file into the Metamath program, enter the program and
type:  "read set.mm <return>".  You should be familiar with chapters 2 and
4 of the 'Metamath' book to understand the Metamath language.  Chapters 2,
3 and 5 explain how to use the program.  Chapter 3 gives you an informal
overview of what this source file is all about.  Appendix A shows you the
standard mathematical symbols corresponding to the ASCII tokens in this file.
Note: at the end of this file is a big comment containing all tokens
in this file and their LaTeX definitions.  You may want to keep it updated
and use it to replace the latex.def file if you change or add tokens.

The ASCII tokens may seem cryptic at first, even if you are familiar with set
theory, but a review of the definition summary in Chapter 3 should quickly
enable you to see the correspondence to standard mathematical notation. To
easily find the definition of a token, search for the first occurrences of the
token surrounded by spaces.  Some odd-looking ones include "-." for "not", and
"(_" for "is a subset of".  (HELP OPEN TEX tells you how to obtain a LaTeX
output to see the real mathematical symbols.)  Let me know if you have
better suggestions for naming ASCII tokens.

2. Logic and set theory provide a foundation for all of mathematics.  To learn
about them, you should study this source file in conjunction with one or more
of the references listed below.  The textbooks provide a motivation for what we
are doing, whereas Metamath lets you see in detail all hidden and implicit
steps. Most standard theorems are accompanied by citations.  Some closely
followed texts include the following:

  Axioms of propositional calculus - Margaris.
  Axioms of predicate calculus - Megill (System S3' in the article referenced).
  Theorems of propositional calculus - Whitehead and Russell.
  Theorems of pure predicate calculus - Margaris.
  Theorems of equality and substitution - Monk2, Tarski, Megill.
  Axioms of set theory - Bell and Machover.
  Development of set theory - Takeuti and Zaring.  (The first part of Quine's
      book has a good explanation of the powerful device of "virtual" or
      abstraction classes, which is essential to our development.)
  Construction of real and complex numbers - Gleason
  Theorems about real numbers - Apostol

3. Convention:  All $a statements starting with "|-" have labels
starting with "ax-" (axioms), "df-" (definitions), "mt-" (metatheorems),
or "dm-" (definitions with implicit metatheorems).  "ax-" corresponds to
what is traditionally called an axiom.  "df-" introduces new symbols or
a new relationship among symbols that can be easily eliminated; they
always extend the definition of a wff or class.  "mt-" introduces no new
symbol relationships but is not directly provable in the language up to
that point.  "dm-" is a definition with an implicit underlying
metatheorem.  Metamath blindly treats $a statements as known facts;
their justification is the job of mathematicians and philosophers.
Generally our philosophy is to avoid the use of "mt-" and "dm-" unless
they offer a significant practical value.

4. Our method of definition, the axioms for predicate calculus, and the
development of substitution are somewhat different from those found in
standard texts.  The axioms were designed for direct derivation of
standard results without excessive use of metatheorems.  (See Theorem
9.7 of [Megill] for a rigorous justification.)  Typically we are
minimalist when introducing new definitions; they are introduced only
when a clear advantage becomes apparent for reducing the number of
symbols, shortening proofs, etc.  We avoid the introduction of excessive
definitions because each one requires associated theorems and additional
elimination steps in proofs.

5. For the most part, the notation conforms to modern conventions, with
variations due to our choice of the axiom system or to make proofs
shorter.  Listed below are some important conventions and how they
correspond to textbook language.  The notation is usually explained in
more detail when first introduced.

  Typically, Greek letters (ph = phi, ps = psi, ch = chi, etc.) are used for
      propositional (wff) variables; x,y,z,... for individual (i.e. set)
      variables; and A,B,C,... for class variables.
  "|-", meaning "It is provable that," is the first token of all assertions
      and hypotheses that aren't syntax constructions.  This is a standard
      convention in logic.  For us, it also prevents any ambiguity with
      statements that are syntax constructions, such as "wff -. ph".
  "$e |- ( ph -> A. x ph ) $." should be read "Assume variable x is
      (effectively) not free in wff phi."  Literally, this says "Assume it is
      provable that phi implies for all x phi."
  "|- ( -. A. x x = y -> ..." should be read "If x and y are distinct
      variables, then..."  This antecedent provides us with a technical
      device (called a "distinctor" in [Megill]) to avoid the need for the
      $d statement early in our development of predicate calculus, permitting
      unrestricted substitituions as conceptually simple as those in
      propositional calculus.  However, the $d eventually becomes a
      requirement, and after that this device is rarely used.
  "( ph x | y )" should be read "the wff that results when y is properly
      substituted for x in ph."
  "$d x y $." should be read "Assume x and y are distinct variables."
  "$d x ph $." should be read "Assume x does not occur in phi $."  Sometimes
      a theorem is proved with "$e |- ( ph -> A. x ph ) $." in place of
      "$d x ph $." when a more general result is desired; ~ax-17 can be used
      to derive the $d version.  For an example of how to get from the $d
      version back to the $e version, see the proof of ~euf from ~df-eu .
  "$d x A $." should be read "Assume x is not a variable occurring in class
      A."
  "$d x A $.  $d x ps $.  $e |- ( x = A -> ( ph <-> ps ) ) $." is often used
      instead of explicit substitution, meaning "Assume psi results from the
      substitution of A for x in phi".
  "$e |- A e. V $." should be read "Assume class A is a set (i.e. exists)."
      This is a convenient convention used by Quine (see references).
  "$d x y $.  $e |- y e. A -> A. x y e. A $." should be read "Assume x is
      (effectively) not a free variable in class A."
  "`' R" should be read "converse of (relation) R" and is the same as
      the more standard notation R^{-1}.
  "( f ` x )" should be read "the value of function f at x" and is the same
      as the more familiar f(x).
  The Deduction Theorem of standard logic is never used.  Instead, in
      set theory we use other tricks to make a $e hypothesis become
      an antecedent.  See the section below called "The Deduction Theorem in
      set theory" for a description of this technique.
