The HELP LANGUAGE command in the Metamath program will give you a quick
overview of Metamath.  Syntax summary:
          $c ... $. - Constant declaration
          $v ... $. - Variable declaration
          $d ... $. - Disjoint (distinct) variable restriction
    label $f ... $. - "Floating" (variable-type) hypothesis
    label $e ... $. - "Essential" (logical) hypothesis (e.g. theorem assumption)
    label $a ... $. - Axiom or definition or syntax construction
    label $p ... $= ... $. - Theorem and its proof
          ${ ... $} - Block for scoping above statements (except $a, $p
                      which are forever active)
$)        $( ... $) $( - Comments (may not be nested)
          $[ ... $] - Include file

The above tokens (i.e. those beginning with "$") are the ONLY primitives
built into the Metamath language.  The only 'logic' Metamath uses in its
proof verification algorithm is the substitution of expressions for
variables while checking for distinct variable violations.  EVERYTHING
ELSE, including the axioms for logic, is defined in this database file.

Inside of comments, it is recommended that labels be preceded with a tilde (~)
and math symbol tokens be enclosed in grave accents (` `).  This way the
LaTeX rendition of comments will be accurate, and (future) tools to globally
change labels and math symbols will also change them in comments.  Note
that `` inside of grave accents is interpreted as a single `.

The proofs in this file are in "compressed" format for storage efficiency. The
Metamath program reads the compressed format directly.  This format is
described in an Appendix of the Metamath book.  It is not intended to be
read by humans.  For viewing proofs you should use the various SHOW PROOF
commands described in the Metamath book.
