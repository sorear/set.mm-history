$( Quick "How To" use this file (under Windows 95/98):

   1. Download the program metamath.exe from
      ftp://ftp.shore.net/members/ndm/windows95 and put it in the same
      directory as this file (set.mm).
   2. From Start select Run and type the directory and file, e.g.
      c:\metamath\metamath.exe
   3. From the MM> prompt type "read set.mm".
   4. To find a statement with a phrase (e.g. "conjunction") in its comment,
      type "search * 'conjunction' /comments".  You will see statement
      labels e.g. "iman" followed by comment excerpts.
   5. To see the statement type "show statement iman /brief", or omit the
      "/brief" for full information.
   6. To see the proof in textbook (Lemmon) format type "show proof iman
      /lemmon/essential/renumber".  To see the proof in an indented tree
      format (which I prefer for readability) omit "/lemmon".
   7. Each proof step references a previous axiom ($a) or theorem ($p).
      Repeat steps 5 and 6 for any theorem reference to eventually trace
      back to axioms.

   As an aid for studying set theory, see if the exercise or theorem is listed
   under the author's name, e.g. Suppes or Enderton.  However there is only
   one author listed per theorem, so also learn to search by symbol; e.g.
   "search * '(/)'" will show theorems about the empty set.  The first two
   statements with a symbol show its type (e.g. "wff" or "class") then its
   definition.

   The end of this file has the LaTeX names for all symbols that are used.
   To typeset a theorem for publication, just make a one for one symbol
   substitution (or see "help tex" to let Metamath do it).
