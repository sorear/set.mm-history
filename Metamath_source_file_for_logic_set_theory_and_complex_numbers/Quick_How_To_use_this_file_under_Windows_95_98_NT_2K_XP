   Quick "How To" use this file (under Windows 95/98/NT/2K/XP):

   1. Download the program metamath.exe per the instructions on the
      Metamath home page (http://metamath.org) and put it in the same
      directory as this file (set.mm).
   2. From Start select Run and type the directory and file, e.g.
      c:\metamath\metamath.exe
   3. From the MM> prompt type "read set.mm".
   4. To find a statement with a phrase (e.g. "conjunction") in its comment,
      type "search * 'conjunction' /comments".  You will see statement
      labels e.g. "iman" followed by comment excerpts.
   5. To see the statement type "show statement iman", or for more information
      type "show statement iman/full".
   6. To see the proof in textbook (Lemmon) format type "show proof iman
      /lemmon/renumber".  To see the proof in an indented tree
      format (which I prefer for readability) omit "/lemmon".
   7. Each proof step references a previous axiom ($a) or theorem ($p).
      Repeat steps 5 and 6 for any theorem referenced to trace back until
      axioms are reached.

   As an aid for studying set theory, see if the exercise or theorem is listed
   under the reference, e.g. [Suppes] or [Enderton].  However there is only
   one author listed per theorem, so also learn to search by symbol; e.g.
   "search * '(/)'" will show theorems about the empty set.  The first two
   statements with a symbol show its type (e.g. "wff" or "class") then its
   definition.

   The (unique) comment in this file containing "$" followed by "t" has the
   LaTeX and HTML mappings for all symbols.  See "help tex" and "help html".
