$(???TO BE DONE LIST
BOOK
1. add Ord On to th. list
4. "If only there were a way to harness some of the rather astonishing
human intellectual energy spent on chess games and word puzzles, so that
rather than ultimately going to waste it could find some permanence in the
discovery of new mathematics and incrementally add to the repository of
human knowledge.  Even if one individual's discovery is trivial, say merely
shortening an existing proof by a step or two, the sum of all such efforts,
properly organized, might be significant."
6. HELP CLI:  mention that Q suppresses printout until the next input
request (e.g. MM> prompt), but the operation still completes internally.
Also:  mention what S means.
7. HELP TRACE : "<label>" missing.  (?)
8. (8/18/96) _{ _} start/end subscript _ subscript next token only
^ superscript next token only ^{ ^} start/end superscript
(also in latex.def)

2. "B" should give bell after continue question
  also : space = 1 line - or b = back
3. "RENAME" (or SUBSTITUTE LABEL) command  RENAME th1 th2:  refuse if th2
already exists
5. Add $d checking to IMPROVE
6. IMPROVE /LENGTH <number> - This switch will cause the search to
        consider only subproofs with <number> or less steps.  Useful for
        partial improvements (before SAVEing the intermediate proof) when
        memory or CPU time is limited.
7. SAVE PROOF <label> (NEW_PROOF) / OPTIMIZED - look for label list order
with shortest compressed proof length?
8. Make IMPROVE look at known steps of proof.
9. HELP CLI:  mention that Q suppresses printout until the next input
request (e.g. MM> prompt), but the operation still completes internally.
Also:  mention what S means.
9. HELP TRACE : "<label>" missing.
10. Abort immediately after Q in show proof, etc.
11. Add background processing for Mac
12. Revamp memory management
13. Mac:  more typeahead; command line recall on arrow
14. Mac:  Code Warrior compilation
15. Bug seen: after lots of SHO US and SAVE/COMPR, ERASE (?then READ) crashed
16. Sort unification choices in order of least total subst. length
17. "Substitution with empty symbol sequences is no longer allowed." ->
    "You have prohibited substitution with empty symbol sequences."
18. VERIFY PROOF: if no * in name, check to see if statement exists
 21. MATCH command - add statement filter e.g. *abcl*
 22. Other statements - save proof,... have wildcard
 23. In PROVE, upon entering put "Warning:  $d statements are ignored by the
Proof Assistant.  You must type SAVE NEW_PROOF then VERIFY PROOF xxx to
check for $d violations."
 24. When operating system command on SCO Unix, says "-c: bad option(s)"
but still executes correctly.
 25. (2/95?) ?3 dupl. labels give wrong stmt # in error msg.
 27. enforce $f (1) <const, var> (2) only 1 type per variable
19. Include $d's in /BRIEF
21. Print success msg after verify proof *
22. Build compound $d's for proof displays
23. UNDO command

1. Shorten proofs using vtoclg/pm2.43xx with vtocl2ga
2. Shorten proofs using ecelqsi/opelxpi w/ ecopqsi
5. Shorter finds proof? (see 3/23/96)
6. Shorter 1<1+1 or A<A+B for N_i? see 3/24/96 9-3.4((3))
7. Consolidate 1<1+1 into A<A+B for N_q
8. Suggestion:  make use of -1_r to show actual element for exist. neg. in CC
9. Do we need the <- direction of ltexpi, ltexpq?
9a. Can we use ltexpq2 instead of ltexpq everywhere?
10. Use proof method of addcanpr in mulcanpi?  Thus eliminate nnmcan?
   Eliminate caoprcan in ecopoprtrn -> ecopoprer -> enqer,enrer?
11. Use ltexpq as def. for less than on pos. fractions?
12. Note similarity in mulidpq and 0idsr but dissimilar proofs...
13. gencl,2,3 - make 1st hyp. equivalence for shorter proofs using them
14. Add cbvabv and shorten proofs using cbvab
15. ( R [ A ] ) -> [ A ] _{ R _}
15. ( R [ A ] ) -> [ A ] _{ R }_
16. Shorten some proofs using mo2icl?
    Was: F(x)/\F(y)->x=A/\y=A (->x=y) Is: F(x)->x=A  (to get E.*x)
17. Put dmco proof into fvco - will it shorten? (if dmco not useful)
18. rspec2,3 and other r* w/ 2 vars: make more general e. A, e. B
