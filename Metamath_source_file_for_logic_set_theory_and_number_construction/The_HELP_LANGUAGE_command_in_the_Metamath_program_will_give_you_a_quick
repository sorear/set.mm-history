The HELP LANGUAGE command in the Metamath program will give you a quick
overview of Metamath.  Syntax summary:
          $c ... $. - Constant declaration
          $v ... $. - Variable declaration
          $d ... $. - Disjoint (distinct) variable restriction
    label $f ... $. - Floating (variable-type) hypothesis
    label $e ... $. - Essential (logical) hypothesis (e.g. theorem assumption)
    label $a ... $. - Axiom or definition or syntax construction
    label $p ... $= ... $. - Theorem and its proof
          ${ ... $} - Block for scoping above statements (except $a, $p
                      which are forever active)
$)        $( ... $) $( - Comments (may not be nested)
          $[ ... $] - Include file

The above tokens (i.e. those beginning with "$") are the ONLY primitives built
into the Metamath language.  The only 'logic' Metamath uses is substitution of
expressions for variables. EVERYTHING ELSE, including logic, is defined in this
database file.

Inside of comments, it is recommended that labels be preceded with a tilde (~)
and math symbol tokens be enclosed in grave accents (` `).  This way the
LaTeX rendition of comments will be accurate, and (future) tools to globally
change labels and math symbols will also change them in comments.  Note
that `` inside of grave accents is interpreted as a single `.

The proofs in this file are in "compressed" format for storage efficiency. The
Metamath program reads the compressed format directly.  If you wish you can
convert specific proofs to the format described in the Metamath book with the
SAVE PROOF <label>/NORMAL command.  Of course, for studying proofs you should
use the various SHOW PROOF commands.
