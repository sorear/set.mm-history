  $( Extend class notation to include unary minus.  The symbol ` -u ` is
     not a class by itself but part of a compound class definition.  We
     do this rather than making it a formal function since it is so
     commonly used.  Note: We use different symbols for unary minus
     ( ` -u ` ) and subtraction ~ cmin ( ` - ` ) to prevent syntax ambiguity.
     For example, looking at the syntax definition ~ co , if we used the same
     symbol then " ` ( - A - B ) ` " could mean either " ` - A ` " minus
     " ` B ` ", or it could represent the (meaningless) operation of classes
     " ` - ` " and " ` - B ` " connected with "operation" " ` A ` ".  On the
     other hand, " ` ( -u A - B ) ` " is unambiguous. $)
