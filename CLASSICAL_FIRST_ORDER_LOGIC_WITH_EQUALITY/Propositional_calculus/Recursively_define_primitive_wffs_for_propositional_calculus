  $( If ` ph ` is a wff, so is ` -. ph ` or "not ` ph ` ."  Part of the
     recursive definition of a wff (well-formed formula).  In classical logic
     (which is our logic), a wff is interpreted as either true or false.  So if
     ` ph ` is true, then ` -. ph ` is false; if ` ph ` is false, then
     ` -. ph ` is true.  Traditionally, Greek letters are used to represent
     wffs, and we follow this convention.  In propositional calculus, we define
     only wffs built up from other wffs, i.e. there is no starting or "atomic"
     wff.  Later, in predicate calculus, we will extend the basic wff
     definition by including atomic wffs ( ~ weq and ~ wel ). $)
  wn $a wff -. ph $.

  $( If ` ph ` and ` ps ` are wff's, so is ` ( ph -> ps ) ` or " ` ph ` implies
     ` ps ` ."  Part of the recursive definition of a wff.  The resulting wff
     is (interpreted as) false when ` ph ` is true and ` ps ` is false; it is
     true otherwise.  (Think of the truth table for an OR gate with input
     ` ph ` connected through an inverter.)  The left-hand wff is called the
     antecedent, and the right-hand wff is called the consequent.  In the case
     of ` ( ph -> ( ps -> ch ) ) ` , the middle ` ps ` may be informally called
     either an antecedent or part of the consequent depending on context. $)
