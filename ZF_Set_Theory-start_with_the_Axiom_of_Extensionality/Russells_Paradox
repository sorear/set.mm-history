    $( Russell's Paradox.  Proposition 4.14 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 14.  Frege's
       Axiom of (unrestricted) Comprehension, expressed in our notation as
       ` A e. V ` , asserted that any collection of sets ` A ` is a set i.e.
       belongs to the universe ` V ` of all sets.  In particular, by
       substituting ` { x | x e/ x } ` (the "Russell class") for ` A ` , it
       asserted ` { x | x e/ x } e. V ` , meaning that the "collection of all
       sets which are not members of themselves" is a set.  However, here we
       prove ` { x | x e/ x } e/ V ` . This contradiction was discovered by
       Russell in 1901 (published in 1903), invalidating Comprehension and
       leading to the collapse of Frege's system.

       In 1908 Zermelo rectified this fatal flaw by replacing Comprehension
       with a weaker Subset (or Separation) Axiom ~ ssex asserting that ` A `
       is a set only when it is smaller than some other set ` B ` . However,
       Zermelo was then faced with a "chicken and egg" problem of how to show
       ` B ` is a set, leading him to introduce the set-building axioms of Null
       Set ~ 0ex , Pairing ~ prex , Union ~ uniex , Power Set ~ pwex , and
       Infinity ~ omex to give him some starting sets to work with (all of
       which, before Russell's Paradox, were immediate consequences of Frege's
       Comprehension).  In 1922 Fraenkel strengthened the Subset Axiom with our
       present Replacement Axiom ~ funimaex (whose modern formalization is due
       to Skolem, also in 1922).  Thus in a very real sense Russell's Paradox
       spawned the invention of ZF set theory and completely revised the
       foundations of mathematics!

       Another mainstream formalization of set theory, devised by von
       Neumann, Bernays, and Goedel, uses class variables rather than set
       variables as its primitives.  The axiom system NBG in [Mendelson]
       p. 225 is suitable for a Metamath encoding.  NBG is a conservative
       extension of ZF in that it proves exactly the same theorems as ZF that
       are expressible in the language of ZF.  An advantage of NBG is that it
       is finitely axiomatizable - the Axiom of Replacement can be broken down
       into a finite set of formulas that eliminate its wff metavariable.
       Finite axiomatizability is required by some proof languages (although
       not by Metamath).  There is a stronger version of NBG called
       Morse-Kelley (axiom system MK in [Mendelson] p. 287).

       Russell himself continued in a different direction, avoiding the paradox
       with his "theory of types."  Quine extended Russell's ideas to formulate
       the very strong New Foundations set theory (axiom system NF of [Quine]
       p. 331).  In NF, the collection of all sets is a set, contradicting ZF
       and NBG set theories, and it has other bizarre consequences:  when sets
       become too huge (beyond the size of those used in standard mathematics),
       the Axiom of Choice ~ ac4 and Cantor's Theorem ~ canth are provably
       false!  (See ~ ncanth for some intuition behind the latter.)
       Nonetheless, NF has not been shown to be inconsistent and has its
       advocates - who's to say which set theory is "right"?  NF is finitely
       axiomatizable and can be encoded in Metamath using the axioms from
       T. Hailperin, "A set of axioms for logic," _J. Symb. Logic_ 9:1-19
       (1944).

       Under our ZF set theory, every set is a member of the Russell class by
       ~ elirrv (derived from the Axiom of Regularity), so for us the Russell
       class equals the universe ` V ` (theorem ~ ruv ).  See ~ ruALT for an
       alternate proof of ~ ru derived from that fact. $)
