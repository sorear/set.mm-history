  $)

  $( Axiom _Simp_.  Axiom A1 of [Margaris] p. 49.  One of the 3 axioms of
     propositional calculus.  The 3 axioms are also given as Definition 2.1
     of [Hamilton] p. 28.  This axiom is called _Simp_ or "the principle of
     simplification" in _Principia Mathematica_ (Theorem *2.02 of
     [WhiteheadRussell] p. 100) because "it enables us to pass from the joint
     assertion of ` ph ` and ` ps ` to the assertion of ` ph ` simply."

     Propositional calculus (axioms ~ ax-1 through ~ ax-3 and rule ~ ax-mp )
     can be thought of as asserting formulas that are universally "true" when
     their variables are replaced by any combination of "true" and "false".
     Propositional calculus was first formalized by Frege in 1879, using as
     his axioms (in addition to rule ~ ax-mp ) the wffs ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 ,
     ~ pm2.04 , ~ con3 , ~ nega , and ~ negb .  Around 1930, Lukasiewicz
     simplified the system by eliminating the third (which follows from the
     first two, as you can see by looking at the proof of ~ pm2.04 ) and
     replacing the last three with our ~ ax-3 .  (Thanks to Ted Ulrich
     for this information.)

     The theorems of propositional calculus are also called _tautologies_.
     Tautologies can be proved very simply using truth tables, based on the
     true/false interpretation of propositional calculus.  To do this, we
     assign all possible combinations of true and false to the wff variables
     and verify that the result (using the rules described in ~ wi and ~ wn )
     always evaluates to true.  This is called the _semantic_ approach.  Our
     approach is called the _syntactic_ approach, in which everything is
     derived from axioms.  A metatheorem called the Completeness Theorem for
     Propositional Calculus shows that the two approaches are equivalent and
     even provides an algorithm for automatically generating syntactic proofs
     from a truth table.  Those proofs, however, tend to be long, and the
     much shorter proofs that we show here were found manually.  Truth tables
     grow exponentially with the number of variables, but it is unknown if the
     same is true of proofs - an answer to this would resolve the P=NP
     conjecture in complexity theory. $)

  $( Axiom _Frege_.  Axiom A2 of [Margaris] p. 49.  One of the 3 axioms of
     propositional calculus.  It distributes an antecedent over two
     consequents.  This axiom was part of Frege's original system and is known
     as _Frege_ in the literature.  It is also proved as Theorem *2.77 of
     [WhiteheadRussell] p. 108.  $)

  $( Axiom _Transp_.  Axiom A3 of [Margaris] p. 49.  One of the 3 axioms of
     propositional calculus.  It swaps or transposes the order of the
     consequents when negation is removed.  An informal example is that the
     statement "if there are no clouds in the sky, it is not raining" implies
     the statement "if it is raining, there are clouds in the sky."  This
     axiom is called _Transp_ or "the principle of transposition" in
     _Principia Mathematica_ (Theorem *2.17 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 103).  $)
