  $( Declare the equality predicate symbol. $)
  $c = $.  $( Equal sign (read:  'is equal to') $)

  $( Extend wff definition to include atomic formulas using the equality
     predicate. $)
  weq $a wff x = y $.

  $( Axiom of Equality.  One of the 5 equality axioms of predicate calculus.
     This is similar to, but not quite, a transitive law for equality (proved
     later as ~ eqt ).  Axiom scheme C8' in [Megill] p. 448  (p. 16 of the
     preprint).  Also appears as Axiom C7 of [Monk2] p. 105.

     Axioms ~ ax-8 through ~ ax-16 are the axioms having to do with
     equality, substitution, and logical properties of our binary predicate
     ` e. ` (which later in set theory will mean "is a member of").  Note
     that all axioms except ~ ax-16 and ~ ax-17 are still valid even when
     ` x ` , ` y ` , and ` z ` are replaced with the same variable because they
     do not have any distinct variable (Metamath's $d) restrictions.  Distinct
     variable restrictions are required for ~ ax-16 and ~ ax-17 only. $)
  ax-8  $a |- ( x = y -> ( x = z -> y = z ) ) $.

  $( Axiom of Existence.  One of the 5 equality axioms of equality in predicate
     calculus.  This axiom in effect tells us that at least one thing exists.
     In this form (not requiring ` x ` and ` y ` to be distinct) it was used
     in an axiom system of Tarski (see Axiom B7' in footnote 1 of
     [KalishMontague] p. 81.  It is equivalent to axiom scheme C10' in [Megill]
     p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint); the equivalence is established by
     ~ ax9 and ~ ax9a .  A more convenient form of this axiom is ~ a9e . $)
  ax-9 $a |- -. A. x -. x = y $.

  $( Axiom of Quantifier Substitution.  One of the 5 equality axioms of
     predicate calculus.  This is a technical axiom wherein the antecedent
     is true only if ` x ` and ` y ` are the same variable, and in that
     case it doesn't matter which one you use in a quantifier.  Axiom scheme
     C11' in [Megill] p. 448  (p. 16 of the preprint).  It apparently does not
     otherwise appear in the literature but is easily proved from textbook
     predicate calculus by cases.  (Strictly speaking, the antecedent is
     also true when ` x ` and ` y ` are different variables in the case of
     a one-element domain of discourse, but then the consequent is also
     true in a one-element domain.  For compatibility with traditional
     predicate calculus all our predicate calculus axioms hold in a one-element
     domain, but this becomes unimportant in set theory where we show in ~ dtru
     that at least 2 things exist.) $)
  ax-10 $a |- ( A. x x = y -> ( A. x ph -> A. y ph ) ) $.

  $( Axiom of Variable Substitution.  One of the 5 equality axioms of predicate
     calculus.  The antecedent becomes false if the same variable is
     substituted for ` x ` and ` y ` , ensuring the axiom is sound whenever
     this is the case.  The final consequent ` A. x ( x = y -> ph ) ` is a way
     of expressing " ` y ` substituted for ` x ` in wff ` ph ` ".  Axiom scheme
     C15' in [Megill] p. 448  (p. 16 of the preprint).  It is based on Axiom C8
     of [Monk2] p. 105, from which it is easily proved by cases.  To
     understand this easier, think of ` -. A. x x = y -> ` ... as an informal
     equivalent for "if ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct variables then..."
     In some later theorems we call an antecedent of the form ` -. A. x x = y `
     a "distinctor".  $)
  ax-11 $a |- ( -. A. x x = y ->
               ( x = y -> ( ph -> A. x ( x = y -> ph ) ) ) ) $.

  $( Axiom of Quantifier Introduction.  One of the 5 equality axioms of
     predicate calculus.  Informally, it says that whenever ` z ` is distinct
     from ` x ` and ` y ` , and ` x = y ` is true, then ` x = y ` quantified
     with ` z ` is also true.  In other words, ` z ` is irrelevant to the
     truth of ` x = y ` .  Axiom scheme C9' in [Megill] p. 448  (p. 16 of
     the preprint).  It apparently does not otherwise appear in the literature
     but is easily proved from textbook predicate calculus by cases. $)
  ax-12 $a |- ( -. A. z z = x -> ( -. A. z z = y ->
              ( x = y -> A. z x = y ) ) ) $.
