   Predicate calculus, or first-order logic, introduces quantifiers to make
   statements such as 'for all individuals, such-and-such is true' and 'there
   exist individuals such that... .'  We introduce a new kind of variable,
   called an 'individual variable,' that ranges over individuals.
   (Actually, in Metamath we are introducing 'metavariables' that range over
   the individual variables of textbook predicate calculus, but the theorems
   look the same.  This is a technical point you should be aware of when
   studying standard textbooks.)  In addition, predicate calculus introduces
   one or more 'predicate symbols' that combine individual variables to form
   wff's.  We will be concerned with two predicate symbols, the equality
   sign ` = ` used in all of mathematics and the stylized epsilon ` e. `
   used to express 'is an element of' in set theory.

   Our axioms look quite different from those in standard textbooks, but the
   rules for manipulating the symbols end up being considerably simpler.
   The axioms of standard textbooks are derived as theorems ~stdpc4 and
   ~stdpc5 .

   We will work with the axioms for predicate calculus in four phases.  Phase 1
   introduces pure predicate calculus, which has no predicate symbols.  Phase 2
   introduces the predicate symbol for equality.  Phase 3 introduces the
   stylized epsilon predicate symbol for set theory (without specifying any of
   its properties that are peculiar to set theory).  Phase 4 introduces the
   concept of distinct variables (our first use of the $d statement).

   After phase 3, we will define and develop the concept of
   substitution.  In standard textbooks, substitution is introduced immediately
   as a complex concept that is awkward to work with in a precise, mechanical
   way.  We will define it in terms of concepts contained in the
   axioms so that in principle it can be eliminated from the language
   entirely.

   Finally, we will define existential uniqueness and develop some basic facts
   about it.
