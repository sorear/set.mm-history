    $( Poisson d'Avril's Theorem.  This theorem is noted for its
       _Selbstdokumentieren_ property, which means, literally,
       "self-documenting" and recalls the principle of _quidquid germanus
       dictum sit, altum viditur_, often used in set theory.  Starting with the
       seemingly simple yet profound fact that any object ` x ` equals itself
       (proved by Tarski in 1965; see Lemma 6 of [Tarski] p. 68), we
       demonstrate that the power set of the real numbers, as a relation on the
       value of the imaginary unit, does not conjoin with an empty relation on
       the product of the additive and multiplicative identity elements,
       leading to this startling conclusion that has left even seasoned
       professional mathematicians scratching their heads.  (Contributed by
       Prof. Loof Lirpa, updated 1-Apr-06.)

  $( The law of excluded middle.  Act III, Theorem 1 of Shakespeare,

     exercise for the reader - "To be, or not to be: that is the question" -
     starting a trend that has become standard in modern-day textbooks,
     serving to make the frustrated reader feel inferior, or in some cases to
     hide the fact that the author does not know its solution. $)

  $( The classic "Hello world" benchmark has been translated into 314 computer
     programming languages - see ~ http://www.roesler-ac.de/wolfram/hello.htm .
     However, for many years it eluded a proof that it is more than just a
     conjecture, even though a wily mathematician once claimed,
     "I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is
     too narrow to contain."  Using an IBM 709 mainframe, a team of
     mathematicians led by Prof. Loof Lirpa, at the New College of Tahiti,
     were finally able put it rest on April 1, 2007 with a remarkably short
     proof only 4 lines long.  (Lirpa is also well-known for his or her proof
     of Poisson d'Avril's theorem ~ avril1 .) $)
