     programming languages - see ~ http://www.roesler-ac.de/wolfram/hello.htm .
     However, for many years it eluded a proof that it is more than just a
     conjecture, even though a wily mathematician once claimed,
     "I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is
     too narrow to contain."  Using an IBM 709 mainframe, a team of
     mathematicians led by Prof. Loof Lirpa, at the New College of Tahiti,
     were finally able put it rest on April 1, 2007 with a remarkably short
     proof only 4 lines long.  (Lirpa is also well-known for his or her proof
     of Poisson d'Avril's theorem ~ avril1 .) $)
