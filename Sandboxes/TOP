  "Sandboxes" are user-contributed sections that are not officially part
  of set.mm.  They are included in the set.mm file in order to ensure that
  they are kept synchronized with label, definition, and theorem changes
  in set.mm.  Eventually they may be broken out as separate modules,
  particularly in conjunction with future Ghilbert translations.

  Notes:

  1. I (N. Megill) have not necessarily reviewed definitions for soundness
     or agreement with the literature.
  2. Over time I may decide to make certain definitions and theorems
     "official," in which case they will be moved to the appropriate section
     of set.mm and author acknowledgments added to their descriptions.
  3. I may rename statement labels and constants at any time.
  4. I may revise definitions, theorems, proofs, and statement descriptions at
     any time.
  5. I may add or delete theorems and/or definitions at any time.
  6. I may decide to delete part or all of a sandbox at any time, if I feel
     it will not ultimately be useful or for any other reason.

  If you want to preserve your original contribution, keep your own copy
  of it along with the version of set.mm that works with it.  Do not depend
  on set.mm as its permanent archive.

  Syntax guideline:  if at all possible, please use only 0-ary class constants
  new definitions, to make soundness checking easier.

  By making a contribution, you agree to release it into the public domain,
  according to the statement at the beginning of this file.
