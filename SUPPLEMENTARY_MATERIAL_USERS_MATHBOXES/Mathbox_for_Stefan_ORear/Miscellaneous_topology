       is in the open set and the open set contains no interval around it.  The
       special points of a union is at most the special points of the elements.
       An element of the standard basis has at most one special point.  The
       special points of every open set are countable.  Given a countable
       collection of open sets, find a point which is not special for any
       element; [x,x+1) thus has a special point which is not in the union, and
       so cannot be a union of elements of the countable set. $)
