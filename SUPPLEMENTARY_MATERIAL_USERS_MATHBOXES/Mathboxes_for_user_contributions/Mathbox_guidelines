  $( (_This theorem is a dummy placeholder for these guidelines.  The name of
     this theorem, "mathbox", is hard-coded into the Metamath program to
     identify the start of the mathbox section for web page generation_.)

     A "mathbox" is a user-contributed section that is maintained by its
     contributor independently from the main part of set.mm.

     _For contributors_:

     By making a contribution, you agree to release it into the public domain,
     according to the statement at the beginning of set.mm.

     Mathboxes are provided to help keep your work synchronized with changes in
     set.mm, but they shouldn't be depended on as a permanent archive.  If you
     want to preserve your original contribution, it is your responsibility to
     keep your own copy of it along with the version of set.mm that works with
     it.

     _Guidelines_:

     1.  If at all possible, please use only 0-ary class constants for new
     definitions, for example as in ~ df-div .

     2.  Try to follow the style of the rest of set.mm.  Each $p and $a
     statement must be immediately preceded with the comment that will be shown
     on its web page description.  The metamath program command "write source
     set.mm /rewrap" will take care of wrapping comment lines and indentation
     conventions.  All mathbox content will be on public display and should
     hopefully reflect the overall quality of the web site.

     3.  Before submitting a revised mathbox, please make sure it verifies
     against the current set.mm.

     4.  Mathboxes should be independent i.e. the proofs should verify with all
     other mathboxes removed.  If you need a theorem from another mathbox, that
     is fine (and encouraged), but let me know so I can move the theorem to the
     main section.  One way avoid undesired accidental use of other mathbox
     theorems is to develop your mathbox using a modified set.mm that has
     mathboxes removed.

     _Notes_:

     1.  I may decide to move some theorems to the main part of set.mm for
     general use.  In that case, an author acknowledgment will be added to the
     description of the theorem.

     2.  I may make changes to mathboxes to maintain the overall quality of
     set.mm.  Normally I will let you know if a change might impact what you
     are working on.

     3.  If you use theorems from another user's mathbox, I don't provide
     assurance that they are based on correct or consistent $a statements.  (If
     you find such a problem, please let me know so it can be corrected.) $)
