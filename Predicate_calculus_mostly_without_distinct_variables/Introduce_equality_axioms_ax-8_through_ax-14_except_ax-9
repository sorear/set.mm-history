  $( Axiom of Equality.  One of the equality and substitution axioms of
     predicate calculus with equality.  This is similar to, but not quite, a
     transitive law for equality (proved later as ~ equtr ).  Axiom scheme C8'
     in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).  Also appears as Axiom C7 of
     [Monk2] p. 105.

     Axioms ~ ax-8 through ~ ax-16 are the axioms having to do with equality,
     substitution, and logical properties of our binary predicate ` e. ` (which
     later in set theory will mean "is a member of").  Note that all axioms
     except ~ ax-16 and ~ ax-17 are still valid even when ` x ` , ` y ` , and
     ` z ` are replaced with the same variable because they do not have any
     distinct variable (Metamath's $d) restrictions.  Distinct variable
     restrictions are required for ~ ax-16 and ~ ax-17 only. $)

  $( Axiom of Quantifier Substitution.  One of the equality and substitution
     axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  Appears as Lemma L12 in
     [Megill] p. 445 (p. 12 of the preprint).

     The original version of this axiom was ~ ax-10o ("o" for "old") and was
     replaced with this shorter ~ ax-10 in May 2008.  The old axiom is proved
     from this one as theorem ~ ax10o .  Conversely, this axiom is proved from
     ~ ax-10o as theorem ~ ax10 . $)
  ax-10 $a |- ( A. x x = y -> A. y y = x ) $.

  $( Axiom of Variable Substitution.  One of the 5 equality axioms of predicate
     calculus.  The final consequent ` A. x ( x = y -> ph ) ` is a way of
     expressing " ` y ` substituted for ` x ` in wff ` ph ` " (cf. ~ sb6 ).  It
     is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of [Monk2] p. 105,
     from which it can be proved by cases.

     The original version of this axiom was ~ ax-11o ("o" for "old") and was
     replaced with this shorter ~ ax-11 in Jan. 2007.  The old axiom is proved
     from this one as theorem ~ ax11o .  Conversely, this axiom is proved from
     ~ ax-11o as theorem ~ ax11 .

     Juha Arpiainen proved the independence of this axiom (in the form of the
     older axiom ~ ax-11o ) from the others on 19-Jan-2006.  See item 9a at
     ~ http://us.metamath.org/award2003.html .

     Interestingly, if the wff expression substituted for ` ph ` contains no
     wff variables, the resulting statement _can_ be proved without invoking
     this axiom.  This means that even though this axiom is _metalogically_
     independent from the others, it is not _logically_ independent.
     Specifically, we can prove any wff-variable-free instance of axiom
     ~ ax-11o (from which the ~ ax-11 instance follows by theorem ~ ax11 .)
     The proof is by induction on formula length, using ~ ax11eq and ~ ax11el
     for the basis steps and ~ ax11indn , ~ ax11indi , and ~ ax11inda for the
     induction steps.

     See also ~ ax11v and ~ ax11v2 for other equivalents of this axiom that
     (unlike this axiom) have distinct variable restrictions. $)
  ax-11 $a |- ( x = y -> ( A. y ph -> A. x ( x = y -> ph ) ) ) $.

  $( Axiom of Quantifier Introduction.  One of the equality and substitution
     axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  Informally, it says that
     whenever ` z ` is distinct from ` x ` and ` y ` , and ` x = y ` is true,
     then ` x = y ` quantified with ` z ` is also true.  In other words, ` z `
     is irrelevant to the truth of ` x = y ` .  Axiom scheme C9' in [Megill]
     p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).  It apparently does not otherwise appear
     in the literature but is easily proved from textbook predicate calculus by
     cases.

     An open problem is whether this axiom is redundant.  Note that the
     analogous axiom for the membership connective, ~ ax-15 , has been shown to
     be redundant.  It is also unknown whether this axiom can be replaced by a
     shorter formula.  However, it can be derived from two slightly shorter
     formulas, as shown by ~ a12study . $)
  ax-12 $a |- ( -. A. z z = x -> ( -. A. z z = y ->
              ( x = y -> A. z x = y ) ) ) $.

  $( Axiom of Equality.  One of the equality and substitution axioms for a
     non-logical predicate in our predicate calculus with equality.  It
     substitutes equal variables into the left-hand side of the ` e. ` binary
     predicate.  Axiom scheme C12' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).
     It is a special case of Axiom B8 (p. 75) of system S2 of [Tarski] p. 77.
     "Non-logical" means that the predicate is not a primitive of predicate
     calculus proper but instead is an extension to it.  "Binary" means that
     the predicate has two arguments.  In a system of predicate calculus with
     equality, like ours, equality is not usually considered to be a
     non-logical predicate.  In systems of predicate calculus without equality,
     it typically would be. $)

     that ` x ` is effectively not free in ` x = x ` , even though it is
     technically free according to the traditional definition of free
     variable.  (The proof shows that this can be proved without ~ ax-9 , even
     though the theorem ~ equid cannot be.  A shorter proof that uses ~ ax-9 is
