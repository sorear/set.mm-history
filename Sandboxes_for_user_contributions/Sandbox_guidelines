  $( (This theorem is a dummy placeholder for these guidelines.)

     "Sandboxes" are user-contributed sections that are not officially part of
     set.mm.  They are included in the set.mm file in order to ensure that they
     are kept synchronized with label, definition, and theorem changes in
     set.mm.  Eventually they may be broken out as separate modules,
     particularly in conjunction with any future Ghilbert translation.

     By making a contribution, you agree to release it into the public domain,
     according to the statement at the beginning of set.mm.

     Sandboxes are provided as a courtesy to keep your work synchronized, but
     they shouldn't be depended on as a permanent archive.  If you want to
     preserve your original contribution, it is your responsibility to keep
     your own copy of it along with the version of set.mm that works with it.

     _Notes_:

     1. I (N. Megill) have not necessarily checked definitions for soundness
        nor for agreement with the literature.  In particular, a proof that
        1 = 0 based on a sandbox definition will not considered in any
        challenge to prove set.mm inconsistent.  (Such a proof will still be
        welcome, of course, so that the erroneous definition can be corrected.)

     2. Over time I may decide to make a theorem "official," in which case it
        will be moved to the appropriate section of set.mm with an author
        acknowledgment.

     3. At any time, I may revise definitions, theorems, proofs, and
        statement descriptions; add or delete theorems and/or definitions; or
        delete part or all of a sandbox if I feel it will not ultimately be
        useful or for any other reason.

     _Guidelines_:

     1. If at all possible, please use only 0-ary class constants for new
        definitions, to make soundness checking easier.

     2. Please try to follow the style of the rest of set.mm in terms of
        indentation, line length (79 characters or less), and comment markup
        (see HELP LANGUAGE in metamath.exe).  Each $p and $a statement must be
        immediately preceded with the comment that will be shown on its web
        page description. $)
